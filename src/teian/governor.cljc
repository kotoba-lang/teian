  "BriefingGovernor — the independent censor that earns deck-LLM the right to
  *propose* a draft. The LLM has no notion of tenant boundaries, redaction
  requirements, or the no-actuation charter, so this MUST be a separate
  system (rules over the store's ground facts) able to *reject* a proposal
  and fall back to HOLD — the teian analog of kekkai's TailnetGovernor /
  tayori's ComplianceGovernor.

  The actor is **propose → draft only**. It never delivers a briefing;
  delivery (`:deck/publish`) is ALWAYS routed to a human (the teian analog of
  robotaxi's MRC / itonami's cert hold / tayori's always-human send/publish).
  Below, HARD invariants force HOLD (a human cannot approve past a proposal
  that claims to have already published, a missing redaction on a sensitive
  cite, or a draft declared for the WRONG tenant); a clean publish still
  routes to a human (high-stakes), at every phase.

  HARD invariants:
    :deck/draft
      1. Subject exists    — the artifact (itonami activity) must already be
                             a registered ground fact (an LLM can hallucinate
                             an id; the governor never trusts confidence
                             alone for this).
      2. No-actuation      — proposal :effect must be :draft (a control-
                             plane record), never :published.
      3. Redaction         — every sensitive-category cite (:financial/
                             :legal/:personnel) must appear in :redactions.
      4. Tenant-isolation  — the proposal's declared :tenant must equal the
                             artifact's own registered :repo (no cross-
                             tenant draft).
    :deck/publish
      1. Subject exists    — the artifact must already be registered.
      2. Draft exists      — a draft must already have been committed (you
                             cannot publish what was never proposed).
      3. Redaction (recheck)      — re-runs the redaction check against the
                             CURRENTLY STORED draft (fetched fresh from the
                             store, not trusted from the incoming proposal) —
                             defense-in-depth against the draft having been
                             revised between draft-time approval and this
                             publish-time delivery.
      4. Tenant-isolation (recheck) — same recheck, for the stored draft's
                             :tenant vs. the artifact's own :repo.
    (any op) — an unrecognized :op is itself a hard violation (fail-closed:
               a not-yet-wired op must never silently pass as clean).
  SOFT:
    Confidence floor → escalate.
    `:deck/publish` is high-stakes → ALWAYS human, independent of phase."
