  "DeckTarget port — where a deck/doc/sheet draft becomes a *real* delivered
  briefing. A deck-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record, content = a
  slides.model EDN item) until a human approves it; `publish!` is called
  exactly once, after that approval, by `teian.operation`'s commit step —
  the actuation (best-effort pptx export + handing the result to an injected
  Distributor). `propose-revision!` is the 'casual commit' analog (tayori's
  docport/kekkai's ledger): recording that a draft candidate exists, no
  external effect yet.

  `mock-deckport` is the default — a deterministic in-memory target so the
  actor is runnable/testable with no network/creds (ADR-2607062000
  Consequences: real Distributor clients need per-provider API tokens, live
  binding is out of scope here). `publish!` optionally exports real pptx
  bytes via `kotoba-lang/slides`'s `slides.office` when the content is a
  `:slides/deck` — best-effort: a `:doc`/`:sheet` kind, malformed content, or
  any failure to resolve/run the exporter simply degrades to no pptx bytes
  rather than failing the whole delivery (a preview render is a nicety, not
  the actuation itself). The Distributor is a plain injected fn — the
  default just records what WOULD have been distributed; a real one is
  caller-injected, opt-in, never silently active. `teian.distribute/
  resend-distribute-fn` is a real, Resend-email-backed Distributor
  (JVM-only, touches the network — see README's 'DeckTarget → real backend
  (injection)' section). `slack-deckport` below is a real, Slack
  `chat.postMessage`-backed one, alongside (not replacing) the Resend one —
  request-shape-tested only, no live Slack call anywhere in this repo (see
  README's 'Slack Distributor (owner setup required)' section for what the
  human owner still has to do before it's usable). Neither replaces
  `mock-deckport` as the default; inject either via `mock-deckport`'s
  `distribute-fn` slot."

  "A Slack `chat.postMessage` Distributor for `mock-deckport`'s
  `distribute-fn` slot — an opt-in alternative to the default no-op,
  alongside (not replacing) a Resend-email Distributor landing separately.
  Usage: `(mock-deckport (atom {}) (slack-deckport {:token \"xoxb-...\" :channel \"C0123...\"}))`.

  `:token` (Slack bot token) and `:channel` (target channel id) are
  owner-supplied constructor params — see README's 'Slack Distributor
  (owner setup required)' section; NEVER hardcoded or env-guessed here.

  Posts exactly one `chat.postMessage` per `publish!` call: a short text
  notification (the deck's `:slides/title` + a note a deck was published,
  and whether a pptx export was attempted) — never the deck bytes
  themselves. Attaching the actual pptx would need Slack's separate,
  more complex `files.upload` multipart endpoint; that's a deliberate
  follow-up (see README), not a half-implemented guess here.

  The per-call `:target` (this actor's generic recipient field, e.g. an
  email address for the Resend Distributor) is intentionally NOT used for
  channel routing — Slack delivery is a fixed operational binding (the bot
  must already be invited to a channel, or have `chat:write.public`), not a
  per-message address the way email is; `:channel` is fixed at
  construction instead.

  `:http-fn` / `:json-write` are injected for testability (default: a real
  java.net.http POST / the minimal encoder above) — no live Slack call
  happens anywhere in this repo's automated test suite (there is no bot
  token to call with yet)."
