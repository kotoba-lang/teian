  "Wire a `DatomicStore` to a kotoba-server pod (e.g. kotobase.net) over the
  ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.* XRPC namespace. The store is unchanged — it
  only ever calls the `:db-api` map; `langchain.kotoba-db/kotoba-api` implements
  that map against the remote pod, so this is purely a constructor.

  I/O is injected (langchain's host-caps contract): an http-fn is provided here
  via JDK java.net.http (no dependency), and the JSON pair is passed by the
  caller (e.g. clojure.data.json) so this namespace stays dependency-free.

  The kotobase.net datomic endpoints are auth-gated — pass :token (Bearer JWT)
  or :cacao + :did. A live run therefore needs a credential; the store contract
  itself is already proven backend-agnostic (test/teian/store_contract_test)."
