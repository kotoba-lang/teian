  "REAL email Distributor for `teian.deckport/mock-deckport`'s injected
  `:distribute-fn` slot (README.md 'DeckTarget → real backend (injection)') —
  the concrete, opt-in counterpart to the default no-op distribute-fn.
  Mirrors `cloud-itonami.mail`'s Resend integration exactly: same
  dependency-free `java.net.http` transport (`jvm-http-fn`), same
  `mailer.core/request` request-building, same non-2xx error handling. This
  is the one teian namespace that touches the network or RESEND_API_KEY;
  every other teian ns (deckport included) stays pure per its own contract.

  `mock-deckport`'s `:distribute-fn` is called once per `publish!` with
  `{:activity :target :content :pptx-bytes?}` — `:content` is the verbatim,
  already-governed `slides.model` EDN (never re-read from the store, see
  `teian.operation`'s TOCTOU note), so this ns independently re-derives real
  pptx bytes from `:content` (the same best-effort `slides.office` export
  `mock-deckport` already attempted, just re-run here since only the boolean
  crossed the distribute-fn boundary, not the bytes) rather than requiring
  `deckport.cljc` to thread raw bytes through.

  `kotoba-lang/mailer`'s `mailer.core/message-wire` has no attachment
  concept yet (`mail.message` doesn't model attachments), so this ns augments
  the JSON body `mailer.core/request` builds with a base64 Resend
  `attachments` array directly, per Resend's documented wire format, instead
  of reinventing the rest of the request (from/to/subject/url/auth all still
  come from `mailer.core`/`mail.message`)."
