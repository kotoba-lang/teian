(ns teian.cli
  "Minimal JVM entrypoint for `teian.query` against an EDN-seeded MemStore —
  no StateGraph/checkpointer/advisor spun up, just a status read. For a
  process boundary consumer that needs one artifact's draft status without
  an in-process require across runtimes.

  Usage: `clojure -M -m teian.cli <ledger.edn> <artifact-id>` — prints the
  draft status (\"proposed\"/\"published\"/\"none\") and exits 0 on
  \"published\", 1 otherwise (so callers can also just check the exit code).

  <ledger.edn> holds the same shape as `teian.store/demo-data`'s :artifacts
  map plus an optional :drafts map (at minimum
  {:drafts {\"<artifact-id>\" {:status :published}}})."
  (:require [clojure.edn :as edn]
            [teian.query :as query]
            [teian.store :as store]))

  (let [data (edn/read-string (slurp ledger-path))
        st (store/->MemStore (atom (merge {:ledger [] :drafts {}} data)))
        status (query/draft-status st artifact-id)]
    (println status)
    (System/exit (if (= "published" status) 0 1))))
