  tested only -- no live Slack call anywhere here, there is no bot token
  to call with yet; see README's 'Slack Distributor (owner setup
  required)' section). Every Slack assertion below drives slack-deckport's
  returned distribute-fn with an injected fake :http-fn that just captures
  the request map, the same fake-http-fn testing shape used across this
  workspace's other real-binding-but-untested clients (e.g.
  tayori.channel.slack)."
